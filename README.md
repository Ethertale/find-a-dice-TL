# Find A Dice 🎲

**A fantasy-themed social platform where tabletop RPG players gather, connect, and adventure together.**

Find A Dice is a web application designed to bring Dungeons & Dragons players and other tabletop RPG enthusiasts into a unified digital guild hall. More than just a forum or chat app, Find A Dice lets players fully embody their characters while organizing real-world gaming sessions, forming lasting groups, and building a vibrant community around their shared love of tabletop adventures.

## 🏰 The Vision

Tabletop RPG players are scattered across countless platforms—Discord servers for communication, social media for finding groups, separate tools for character management, and forum posts for event coordination. Find A Dice consolidates this fragmented experience into one immersive platform where everything a player needs exists under one roof, wrapped in a medieval fantasy aesthetic that makes you feel like you've stepped into an actual guild hall.

Whether you're a Dungeon Master looking to recruit players for your next campaign, a player searching for a local game night, or a lore enthusiast wanting to discuss character builds and game mechanics, Find A Dice provides the tools to make those connections meaningful and organized.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎭 Character Creation & Roleplay
Create detailed character profiles that go far beyond a name and class. Players can define their hero's stats, background story, alignment, race, preferences, and all the rich details that bring a D&D character to life. Your character becomes your identity on the platform—every post, every message, and every group interaction happens in-character, fostering genuine roleplay and immersion.

### 🗓️ Event Organization
Plan game sessions, convention meetups, one-shots, or campaign launches through the integrated event system. Event creators can set locations, dates, and times while other users can mark themselves as "Interested" or "Going," making it easy to gauge attendance and build excitement for upcoming sessions. The event board acts as a quest bulletin where adventures are announced and heroes gather.

### ⚔️ Guild System (Groups)
Form permanent adventuring parties or thematic guilds where like-minded players congregate. Groups have dedicated spaces for discussion, shared event calendars, and member management. Whether you're building a party for a long-running campaign or creating a guild dedicated to discussing a specific game system, the group feature provides structure and continuity.

### 💬 Direct Messaging
Connect with fellow players through private correspondence. The chat system uses a parchment-and-scroll aesthetic where messages between two heroes feel like exchanging letters in a fantasy world. Perfect for campaign planning, making friends, or coordinating logistics outside of group spaces.

### 📚 Game Guides & Reference Library
Access comprehensive guides covering D&D classes, races, alignments, and backgrounds. New players can learn the fundamentals while experienced adventurers can refresh their knowledge or explore options for their next character. The guide system serves as the platform's internal tome of knowledge, always available when players need to look something up.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Find A Dice embraces a **medieval fantasy aesthetic** throughout the entire user experience. Every page is styled to resemble elements you might find in a guild hall—ornate wooden panels, aged parchment, bronze metalwork, and golden inscriptions. Form inputs look like writing on vellum, buttons resemble wax seals, navigation feels like reading guild proclamations, and the chat interface mimics exchanging handwritten scrolls.

This thematic consistency serves two purposes. First, it creates an immersive environment that constantly reinforces the fantasy setting, making the platform feel like a natural extension of the games being played. Second, it differentiates Find A Dice from generic social platforms by offering a unique visual identity that resonates with the target audience of fantasy enthusiasts.

The design is fully responsive, ensuring that whether users are browsing on a desktop at home or checking events on their phone before a session, the experience remains beautiful and functional.
